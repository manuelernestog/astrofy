```

### Pages

The `[page].astro` is the route to work with the paginated post list. You can change there the number of items listed for each page and the pagination button labels.

Feel free to modify the content included in the pages that the template contains or add the ones you need.

### Theming

For change the template theme change the `data-theme` atribute of the `<html>` tag in `BaseLayout.astro` file.

You can chose among 30 themes available or create your custom theme. See themes available [here](https://daisyui.com/docs/themes/).

## Sitemap

The Sitemap is generated automatically when you build your website in the root of the domain. Please update the `robots.txt` file in the public folder with your site name URL for the Sitemap.

## Deploy

You can deploy your site on your favorite static hosting service such as Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.

The configuration for the deployment varies depending on the platform where you are going to do it. See the [official Astro information](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/) to deploy your website.

> **⚠️ CAUTION** </br>
> The Blog pagination of this template is implemented using dynamic route parameters in its filename and for now this format is incompatible with SSR deploy configs, so please use the default static deploy options for your deployments.
